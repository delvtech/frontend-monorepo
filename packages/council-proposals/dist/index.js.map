In roughly five days I will be able to pass votes by myself with no further approval because the current quroum threshold on the GSC is one. I believe that no one person should be able to govern the GSC by themselves, and thus I am proposing to effectively lock the GSC until two other delegates join the GSC. Three was chosen as a starting point for one reason, to break a tie. As more delegates join, I'm sure this value will gradually increase but for the time being, a threshold of three will be adequate to ensure some level of participation.\\n\\n### Specification / Proposal Details\\n\\n    Option A [YES] is a vote to increase the quroum threshold to three.\\n    Option B [NO] is a vote to do nothing. \\n\",\n      \"title\": \"EGP-2 - Increase GSC quorum threshold \",\n      \"proposalHash\": \"0xb0f22d54f1cc0fecd1cf098ca476903d507fbf9bf00836cb7fcb830c933e218e\",\n      \"unlock\": 14942227,\n      \"lastCall\": 15378000,\n      \"created\": 14922738,\n      \"forumLink\": \"https://forum.element.fi/discussion/4631-egp2-increase-gsc-quorum-threshold\",\n      \"createdTimestamp\": 1654632842,\n      \"expiration\": 14974707,\n      \"quorum\": \"1100000.0\",\n      \"targets\": [\"0x81758f3361A769016eae4844072FA6d7f828a651\"],\n      \"calldatas\": [\n        \"0x88b49b8332b3be434fca12a37af693421116ab7c7682da00e7283c2530502de382b0464b\"\n      ],\n      \"snapshotId\": \"0x46785a4b78a9d03aeb5cdeb1c3ca4ae02cf9e5aca508e59bef405d16a7c8b4a6\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n","{\n  \"version\": \"0.0.0\",\n  \"snapshotSpace\": \"gsc-elfi.eth\",\n  \"proposals\": []\n}\n","export interface Proposal {\n  /**\n   * A hash of the targets and calldatas for the proposal\n   */\n  proposalHash: string;\n  /**\n   * The nonce identifier of the proposal stored in CoreVoting\n   */\n  proposalId: string;\n\n  /**\n   * The block number the proposal was create at\n   */\n  created: number;\n\n  /**\n   * Human-readable title of the proposal.\n   */\n  title: string;\n\n  /**\n   * Human-readable description of the proposal.\n   */\n  description: string;\n  /**\n   * Timestamp in seconds of the block the proposal was created in\n   */\n  createdTimestamp: number;\n  /**\n   * Block number for last vote\n   */\n  expiration: number;\n  /**\n   * Block number for start of execution period\n   */\n  unlock: number;\n  /**\n   * Block number for end of execution period\n   */\n  lastCall: number;\n\n  /**\n   * Minimum vote power to pass or reject a proposal.
