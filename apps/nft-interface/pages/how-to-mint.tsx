    <h1>Minting release</h1>
    <p>
      This process was designed with three aims: make distribution fair and
      transparent,<mark> ensure access for element community members, </mark>
      and favor humans over bots.
    </p>
    <h2>Community Pre-release</h2>
    <p>
      1,000 elves will be available to mint for element community members
      starting 5:35 p.m. ET on february 9 at <mark> completely free </mark>.
      Each person can mint up to 4 elves. <br /> Active community members are
      defined as anyone who has used element, the defi fixed rate protocol.
      <br /> These members will automatically receive
      <mark> their custom &quot;elf&quot; </mark>, which will grant them access
      to a private Discord channel
      <mark> (#custom-elfi)</mark> where they can get updates about future
      community involvement in the elfiverse and future nft related content.
      <br /> The community pre-release will be
      <mark> open indefinitely until we reach the cap of 1,000. </mark>
    </p>
    <h2>Public release</h2>
    <p>
      The remaining Elves (plus any remaining from the pre-release) will be
      available to mint for the general public at 12 p.m. ET on february 10 at
      <mark> completely free </mark>. Each person can mint up up to 4 elves, and
      this per-wallet cap includes any elves minted in the community-release or
      exchanged on secondary marketplaces.
    </p>
    <h2>Unveiling</h2>
    <p>
      The elves are revealed in weekly batches (Monday and Friday) to ensure
      that minters can&apos;t select their elves based on rarity. Minters may
      view their witches within a few days after minting them. <br />
      After an unveiling, you can always see your elf on our website
      immediately. Connect your wallet at the top right and click on the button
      to go to &quot;Your Wallet,&quot; where you&apos;ll be able to see your
      revealed elf. Wallets and platforms like OpenSea typically take a while
      (sometimes a few hours, sometimes as long as days) to update to the
      refreshed metadata. On your elf&apos;s OpenSea page, you can click a
      &quot;Refresh metadata&quot; button at the top right to request that
      OpenSea refresh the metadata more quickly.
    </p>
    <h2>Gifts</h2>
    <p>
      Each of our HIGH elves Council (the core team) and army (contributors)
      will receive a custom, regenerative-designed elf. <br /> Friends of
      elfiverse with significant followings may receive a elfi. <br />
      Community members who participate in the element governance system may be
      selected to receive a elfi.
